# Bulls-and-Cows-Game
C++ console game inspired by the game Mastermind

As a recent graduate, I've been looking for work in the Video Games field, I took a Udemy Course;

To solidify and learn C++ and especially C++ for Unreal Engine, this is a game that we are guided through building in C++

###### Some features I added;
- A way to have a user select a word length to guess or ask for a random word
- Built a MultiMap to house thousands of isograms, which allows for replayability
- Included the CSV file of isograms that are arranged by word length and alphabetically.

###### Features that need to be refined
- The difficulty scaling needs to be tweaked (Needs more playesting on the harder words to know how many tries is both fair and challenging)
- Go through some of the isograms, the words were found in a dictionary before being filtered into isograms, some words are archaic or acronyms.
